Values are sometimes wrong but seem to match the API from what I can tell 
	I use the "quick_status" to anchor my regex matches so the prices after the last/third time an item is mentioned are the ones the tool should be useing

The Combobox is very broken
		It does sometimes work
			Not as often as I'd like
				Not sure what is borked
